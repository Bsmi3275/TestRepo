***UPDATE 10/15/2020 -- CHANGED ALL DIV TAGS TO A SEMANTIC ELEMENT. THE PAGE WORKS EXACTLY AS IT DID WHEN ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED.

This README is split into three sections:

1) --main README statements--
2) --css comments--
3) --screenshots--

1)README:
The purpose of this project is to migrate to semantic elements. This could mean multiple things: 
    a.) changing every instance of <div> to a semantic element of semant-izing it in some ways.
    b.) trying to simply convert from html4 to html5.
    c.) only changing the classes that have a semantic counterpart.
I took the approach #c. I altered the css to match up with the html that was also altered (ex. <div class="content"> ---> <section> && .content ---> section).

Facts learned from this homework assignment and previous lessions:
    -In html4 .=class(specific, but specially assigned for something that will be seen more than once within the repository/page), #=id(only once).

I also made the links accessible to the handicapped by attaching them to the part of the page which the original code intended for the links to be assigned.


2)CSS (for some reason, my css was unable to allow comments from me. Therefore, I will .):

Lines 11,18,23,27,35,39 //changed .header to header (because it is a semantic element, rather than a class.)

Line 72 //changed .content to section

Line 191,198 //changed .footer to footer

3)Images/Screenshots:
(see "IMGreadme")
I took a screenshot based on what I knew to take. The page itself isnt supposed to look *that much different with the exception of the links. The code is.


Additional statements:
- There were no screenshots to show what the results of the assignment should have been. I followed all instructions given. 
- I do not know how the images came out of the assets file (I may have moved them because I did not know why the images sources wouldnt work *at first). To fix this, I simply changed the sources. 

I did not change to semantic elements any html class or element which was not assigned a semantic replacement. 
I DID change line 30 on the index.html page from a <div class> to a <div id> so the link would direct the user just like the following two elements.
